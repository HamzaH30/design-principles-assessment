  Colour palete: https://coolors.co/2d422c-588157-6a9969-dad7cd
  Primary Colour: #2D422C.
  Secondary Colours: #588157 and #6A9969
  Neutral Colour: #DAD7CD

  This is a monochromatic colour scheme. The main colour of the colour scheme is green. It was chosen because
  it is a warm colour that works well with the neutral colour to provide a relaxed and inviting theme/feeling. 
  Green can help convey to the customer that our restaurant is a healthy option. 
  Furthermore, since the restaurant is based on the Mughal Empire, the main colour is green as it was the main colour 
  of the empire as well.

  The primary colour is a dark green colour. It is used as the main text (headings, paragraphs, etc.).
  There are 2 secondary colours. The first secondary colour (#588157) is used as the background colour for the header, 
  the submit button, the rectangle on the homepage, and the link on the about page. It is also used as the colour 
  for the hr tags under every heading, and the hr tag for the footer. The second secondary colour (#6A9969) is used as
  the background colour for when items in the navigation menu are hovered.

  The neutral colour is a light colour (not as light as white). This was used because the website is a light-theme website, and
  this colour enhances the look of this theme. It is also used the the colour of the text for when the background is not this colour.
  This colour works well with the primary colour to make it stand out and the neutral colour does not compete for attention improving the 
  look of the website.

  vertically (round the x-axis) within 0.8 seconds with a 0.5 second delay.
